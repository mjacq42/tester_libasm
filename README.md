# tester_libasm

## Disclaimer

Main I used for my tests on the libasm project (2020). This is not an official tester and it was not designed for the public.

## Usage

- The test libasm repo should be called "libasm" and located next to the tester. Otherwise location can be changed in the Makefile.
- Run `make` for regular tests.
- `make bonus` to test the bonus functions.

## Remarks

Variable values are sometimes printed. If so they can be printed above the related test.
